# Unity Menu Manager System (UMMS)

Unity Menu Manager System (UMMS) is a simple script used to make menu management more easy in your Unity projects.

# Integration with Existing Projects:

UMMS is really easy to implement, recommended setup is create a "MenuManager" empty object in your scene (one per Scene), this object should have a MenuManager component, on editor you'll see multiple fields where you can specify
Start scripts and methods to execute at the start of the scene. In the future more fields will be implemented.

# Contributions and Support:

UCS is an open-source project, meaning the developer community is welcome to contribute new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Developers can report issues or request additional features through the project's GitHub page.
